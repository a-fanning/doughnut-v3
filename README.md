The data analysis was conducted using R (v.4.4.1). Beyond this base R version, the analysis is dependent on several R packages: 
- the tidyverse suite of packages (v.2.0.0) for organising, manipulating, and visualising the data,
- the zoo package (v.1.8-12) for time-series analysis functionality,
- the lmtest package (v.0.9.40) and the sandwich package (v.3.1.1) for statistical analysis,
- the jsonlite package (v.1.8.9) to convert vector data to nested json format, and
- the ggpubr package (v.0.6.0) for additional data visualisation functionality.
- the Observable platform using the D3 javascript library (v.7.0.0) for the doughnut plots.
